By embracing the principles of design thinking and leveraging insights from diverse sources, we have crafted a solution framework poised to mitigate data inconsistencies and enhance the reliability of data analytics.

Moving forward, continual iteration, adaptation, and a commitment to excellence will be essential in realizing the full potential of our solution in empowering organizations to make informed decisions based on trustworthy data.
